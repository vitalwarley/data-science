# Data Science

This is a learning project towards E2E data science. 

> A simpler and more pragmatic definition is that an end-to-end data scientist can identify the problem, design a solution, ship it, and measure outcomes. -- [Eugene Yan](https://applyingml.com/resources/end-to-end/)

## Aims

I hope to learn and share detailed step-by-step guides on how solve ML (for now deep learning & computer vision) problems -- identification, design, deployment, and monitoring. 

## Resources

### Toolbox

Somethings shouldn't be here, but as I write these words I think of them. Sometime I will reorganize this better -- maybe a new repo called **workflow**.

- vim/neovim/jupyter/etc. TODO: create repo.
- python: best practices in documentation, testing and style. TODO: create repo.
- packages: pytorch, keras, guildai, etc.
- linux/arch linux: optimize workflow. TODO: create repo.
- more: psychology of productivity, tips on problem solving etc.
